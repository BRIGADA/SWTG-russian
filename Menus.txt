ExportHelp=Want to help translate Super Win the Game into more languages?\n\nClick the 'Export Strings' button below to output all the game's string table files.\n\nPlace these in a new folder alongside the 'English' folder that is generated, and the game will detect these the next time you play.\n\nThe string tables consist of key/value pairs in the form of 'Key=Value'. The key should not be changed, only the value.\n\nFiles should be saved in UTF-8 format. Most Latin and Cyrillic characters are supported.\n\nIf you are working on a translation and would like it to be included in the official build, please contact kyle.pittman@minorkeygames.com.\n\nThank you!\n\n--Kyle
